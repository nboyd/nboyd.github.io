  I do machine learning at a <a href="http://www.xgenomes.com">DNA sequencing startup</a>.
  </p>
  <p>
  I did my undergrad at UC Berkeley majoring in math and computer science and working with Dan Klein.
  I stayed for my PhD in statistics supervised by Michael Jordan and Ben Recht.
  Before joining XGenomes I was briefly a postdoc with Aviv Regev at the Broad Institute.

  <p>
  I'm interested in algorithms for optimization, and applications of optimization and machine learning to inverse problems in biology, computational imaging, and physics.
