  I'm currently working at a <a href="http://www.xgenomes.com">DNA sequencing startup</a>.
  </p>
  <p>
  I did my undergrad at UC Berkeley, where I majored in math and computer science and worked with Dan Klein.
  I stayed for my PhD in statistics advised by Michael Jordan and Ben Recht.
  Before joining XGenomes I was briefly a postdoc with Aviv Regev at the Broad Institute.

  I'm interested in algorithms for optimization and machine learning and their application to inverse problems in biology, computational imaging, and physics. I also really like <a href="https://julialang.org/">julia</a>.
